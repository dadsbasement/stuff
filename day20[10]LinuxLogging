   Authentication

        /var/log/auth.log - Authentication related events

        /var/run/utmp - Users currently logged in

        /var/log/wtmp - History file for utmp

        /var/log/btmp - Failed login attempts
        
        
  Application

        apache - Web Server (dir)

        apt - Package Manager (dir)

        /var/log/mysql.log
        
  System

        /var/log/messages - Legacy Catch all

        /var/log/syslog - Ubuntu/Debian Catch all

        dmesg = Device Messenger (queires /proc/kmsg)

            Kernel Ring Buffer - Never fills

            First logs generated by the system
            
            
   Location : /var/log

   Config File : /etc/rsyslog.conf

   Service : /usr/sbin/rsyslogd
   
   
   
   usr/sbin/rsyslogd

    User space daemon - Reads messages written to /dev/log and formats and stores them based on /etc/rsyslog.conf rules.

    syslog() via libc

    kernel ring buffer

    audit records via audit subsystem (auditd)
    
        
        
     /etc/rsyslog.conf

        Log entries follow syslog standard facility.severity

        facility = what program, or part of system, log is from

        severity = urgency
        
        
    tail -f - Continuously show end of file

    less /var/log/syslog - View Log in page viewer

    logger - Send a user generated message to system Log i.e. Starting Update

    > /var/log/messages - Wipes Logs

        Why do this as opposed to deleting/recreating files?

    last -f /var/log{wtmp,btmp} - Needed to view data files

Auditing vs Logging

    Logging is system/application defined

    Auditing is user defined

    [kauditd] - runs at the kernel level and can monitor individual syscalls (/sbin/auditd)

    auditctl - control/config command

    aureport - summary reports of audit logs

    ausearch - query audit logs
