    Stream socket - Normally used with TCP, SCTP, and Bluetooth. A stream socket provides a connection-oriented and sequenced 
    flow of data which has methods for establishment and teardown of connections as well as error detection.

    Datagram socket - Normally used with UDP. A datagram socket is connection-less by nature. 
    Sockets built this way can send and receive data, but there is no mechanism to retransmit data if a packet is dropped.

    Raw socket - A raw socket allows for the direct sending and receiving of IP packets without
    automatic protocol-specific transport layer formatting, meaning that all headers are typically included in the packet 
    and not removed when moving up the network stack.

    Raw sockets are used in user applications such as nmap, tcpdump, and wireshark when using 
    elevated privilege levels. Nmap needs to open raw sockets when attempting to set specific flags for performing certain scans. 
    Tcpdump requires raw sockets in order to receive each packet, in its entirety, for total packet analysis.
