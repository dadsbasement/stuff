$PsHome         # Stores the installation directory for PowerShell
$Home           # Stores the current userâ€™s home directory

$profile | Get-Member -Type NoteProperty                        # Displays the profile values of Names, MemberType, and Paths.
$Profile | get-member -type noteproperty | ft -wrap             # Displays the same results but completed in case it was cut off '...'
$PROFILE | Get-Member -MemberType noteproperty | select name    # Narrowed results to display only Names



 To determines whether individual profiles have been created on the local computer:

Test-Path -Path $profile.currentUsercurrentHost
Test-Path -Path $profile.currentUserAllHosts
Test-Path -Path $profile.AllUsersAllHosts
Test-Path -Path $profile.AllUserscurrentHost



    By default, PowerShell Aliases are not saved if you close a PowerShell window session.

        For example, if you create a few Aliases and close the PowerShell window, you will be required to recreate the same PowerShell aliases.

            This would obviously present a problem if you have Aliases set up for use in PowerShell scripts.

New-Alias -Name DemUsers -Value Get-LocalUser
