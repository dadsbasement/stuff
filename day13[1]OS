$PsHome         # Stores the installation directory for PowerShell
$Home           # Stores the current user’s home directory

$profile | Get-Member -Type NoteProperty                        # Displays the profile values of Names, MemberType, and Paths.
$Profile | get-member -type noteproperty | ft -wrap             # Displays the same results but completed in case it was cut off '...'
$PROFILE | Get-Member -MemberType noteproperty | select name    # Narrowed results to display only Names



 To determines whether individual profiles have been created on the local computer:

Test-Path -Path $profile.currentUsercurrentHost
Test-Path -Path $profile.currentUserAllHosts
Test-Path -Path $profile.AllUsersAllHosts
Test-Path -Path $profile.AllUserscurrentHost



    By default, PowerShell Aliases are not saved if you close a PowerShell window session.

        For example, if you create a few Aliases and close the PowerShell window, you will be required to recreate the same PowerShell aliases.

            This would obviously present a problem if you have Aliases set up for use in PowerShell scripts.

New-Alias -Name DemUsers -Value Get-LocalUser

DAY 2



The registry is comprised of Keys, Subkeys and Values structured in a tree format.

    Keys - are known as Registry Hives and can contain subkeys and values.

    Subkeys - can contain subkeys and values

    Values - contain data in specific formats.


5 HIVES

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE

    HKEY_USERS

    HKEY_CURRENT_USERS

    HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG

    HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
    
    
    
    
    KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM)

Contains configuration information for the entire computer. Its values are read every time the machine is started regardless of the user who logs in. Its subkeys are :

    HARDWARE - contains a database of installed devices along with their drivers

    SAM - Security Account Manager stores user and group accounts along with NTLM hashes of passwords

    Security - Local Security policy accessed by lsass.exe used to determine rights and permissions for users on the machine

    System - Contains keys pertaining to system startup such as programs started on boot or driver load order.



HKEY_USERS (HKU)

Contains all all user profiles on the system. Contains one key per user on the system. Each key is named after the SID(Security Identifier) of the user.
	SID values are unique to each user on the machine.

HKEY_USERS contains some of the following information:

    User Environment settings for the desktop

    Shortcuts

    File associations
    
    
    

    S-1-5-18 refers to LocalSystem account.

    S-1-5-19 refers to LocalService account. It is used to run local services that do not require LocalSystem account.

    S-1-5-20 refers to NetworkService account. It is used to run network services that do not require LocalSystem account.

    S-1-5-21-domain-500 Refers to the built in local administrator account.

reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v testme /t REG_SZ /d C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe

    The /v stands for Value; In this case the name of this Key Value.

    The /t stands for Type; Types can be any of the Data Types that we went over earlier.

    The /d stands for Data; Is what is the actual Data or in this case a command to open a file every time the system is ran.

Get-PSDrive

    To create a new Windows PowerShell drive, you must supply three parameters:

    A Name for the drive (you can use any valid Windows PowerShell name)

    The PSProvider (use "FileSystem" for file system locations, "Registry" for registry locations, and it could also be a shared folder on a remote server.)

    The Root, that is, the path to the root of the new drive.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````


Minimum commands to know

    Query

        Get-ChildItem cmdlet gets the items in one or more specified locations.

        Get-ItemProperty cmdlet gets the items in one or more specified locations.

        Get-Item cmdlet gets the item at the specified location. It doesn’t get the contents of the item at the location unless you use a wildcard character (*) to request all the contents of the item.

    Modify

        Set-ItemProperty cmdlet changes the value of the property of the specified item. example, changing setting to :true or :false.

        Remove-ItemProperty cmdlet to delete registry values and the data that they store.

    Create

        New-Item cmdlet creates a new item and sets its value. In the registry, New-Item creates registry keys and entries.

        New-Itemproperty cmdlet creates a new property for a specified item and sets its value. Typically, this cmdlet is used to create new registry values, because registry values are properties of a registry key item.


`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
New-ItemProperty - Creates a new value associated with a sub key

New-ItemProperty "HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Security\Trusted Documents\TrustRecords" -Name "%USERPROFILE%Downloads/test-document.doc" -PropertyType Binary -Value ([byte[]](0x30,0x31,0xFF)) 

New-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run -Name Test -PropertyType String -Value C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe

get-psdrive is like filesystem only in POWRSHEL
    
    
    Create Temporary or Permanent connections to navigate the registry

        New-PSDrive -Name HKU -PSProvider Registry -Root HKEY_USERS

Using the Registry

    Outcome: The "Using the Registry" section covers the practical uses of the Windows Registry for both offensive and defensive purposes. Cover that any changes are only used if the process reads the new value from the registry. Cover the registries most commonly used for persistence. Cover the registries most commonly used for forensics.

Registry Changes
