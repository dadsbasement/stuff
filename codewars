this splits a string after however many letters defined in parts length

s = "whatisgoinonman"
part_length = 2
def split_in_parts(s, part_length):
    counts = 0
    answer = ""
    for i in s:
        if counts < part_length:
            answer += i
            counts += 1
        else:
            answer = answer + " "  + i
            counts = 1
    return answer
print(split_in_parts(s, part_length))
